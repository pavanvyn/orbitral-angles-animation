# Create an animation of orbital angles

This is a python3-based animator of the Keplerian orbital angles - inclination, longitude of ascending node and argument of periapsis. There is no user input required -- just run the python3 module. It is straightforward to change the orbit parameters and athe camera angles within the code. The default style is dark, but this can be changed internally.
