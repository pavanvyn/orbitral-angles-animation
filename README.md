# Create an animation of orbital angles

This is a `python3`-based animator of the Keplerian orbital angles - inclination, longitude of ascending node and argument of periapsis. Simply running the python3 module is sufficient. It is straightforward to change the orbit parameters and a the camera angles within the code. The default style is dark, but this can be changed. Two example gifs are provided in the repository.
